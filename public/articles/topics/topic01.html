    <p>Computers have become an essential part of modern life. From communication to education, business to entertainment, computers power almost every activity we engage in daily. Understanding the basics of computers is the first step toward using them effectively and efficiently.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-blue-600">What is a Computer?</h2>
    <p>A computer is an electronic device that processes data according to a set of instructions, known as programs. It can perform calculations, store information, and automate complex tasks much faster and more accurately than humans. The main purpose of a computer is to convert raw data into meaningful information.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-blue-600">Main Components of a Computer</h2>
    <p>A typical computer system has two main parts: <strong>hardware</strong> and <strong>software</strong>.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
      <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> These are the physical parts of a computer that you can touch, such as the monitor, keyboard, mouse, CPU (Central Processing Unit), and storage devices.</li>
      <li><strong>Software:</strong> These are the programs and operating systems that tell the computer how to perform specific tasks. Examples include Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-blue-600">Types of Computers</h2>
    <p>Computers come in different sizes and capabilities. The major types include:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
      <li><strong>Personal Computers (PCs):</strong> Designed for individual use at home or work.</li>
      <li><strong>Laptops:</strong> Portable versions of personal computers with built-in screens and batteries.</li>
      <li><strong>Servers:</strong> Powerful systems that provide data and services to other computers over a network.</li>
      <li><strong>Supercomputers:</strong> Extremely fast machines used for scientific research and complex simulations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-blue-600">Basic Computer Functions</h2>
    <p>Every computer performs four primary functions:</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mb-4">
      <li><strong>Input:</strong> Receiving data through devices like a keyboard or mouse.</li>
      <li><strong>Processing:</strong> Performing calculations or logical operations using the CPU.</li>
      <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Saving data temporarily or permanently.</li>
      <li><strong>Output:</strong> Displaying results through monitors, printers, or speakers.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-blue-600">Importance of Computers</h2>
    <p>Computers play a vital role in education, healthcare, business, communication, and entertainment. They enable faster research, efficient data management, and global connectivity through the internet. Learning basic computer skills, such as typing, using applications, and browsing the web, is essential in today’s digital age.</p>

    <p class="mt-6">In conclusion, understanding computer basics helps users make the most of this powerful tool. As technology continues to evolve, computers will remain at the heart of innovation and progress across all sectors.</p>
